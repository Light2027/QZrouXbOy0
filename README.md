+ Read assignment.
+ Researched DNS = Did not start, DNF = Did not finish, DSQ = Disqualified, CAN = Cancelled?, ogV = ?
+ Researched "Handzeit" = This is the time measured by a person using a stopwatch
+ Wrote Email  

Time around 1.35h~

## 01.12.2021
+ Read Response Email -> Not every question answered, so anything out of the ordinary will be deemed as invalid
+ Created Service Interface
+ Created concrete Service
+ Created Unit tests for Service for live unit testing -> Useful in some cases
+ Started working on the main service -> Lots of possible side constraints...

Time around 2.6h~

## 02.12.2021
+ New Idea => TryParse for Milliseconds, Minutes and Hours

## 03.12.2021
+ This is not going to be a good solution, sadly that is all the time I can invest...
+ Time around 3.7h~
+ Found a new and hopefully cleaner approach
+ Time around 4.7h~
+ Mostly done with the base conversion part, validation part is still needed
+ Time around 5.9h~

# 04.12.2021
+ Getting close to finishing the formatter, the rest afterward should not take long
+ Time around 6.9h~

+ Time around 7.7h~
